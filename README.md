Character Generator for the Infinity Engine

This is a character creator for the Infinity Engine. You can set your character's attributes (such as abilities, skills and alike) and press the "Generate Character File" button to get your file ready to be imported in your game.

Note this tool allows creation of non-legit characters, such as evil paladins or fighter/mage/thief halflings.

A working example can be found at [http://infinitychgen.altervista.org/](http://infinitychgen.altervista.org/).
